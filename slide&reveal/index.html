          Hilarious book about how Richard Feynman lived through his life. It
          help me realize I didn't have to be serious all the time!

          More weird and quirky adventures, this time with Jason Zook. I love
          hearing Jason's stories and I wonder how I can make my own unique
          and weird stories!

        <p>
          I went through the online course instead of the book. It completely
          reshaped my views on Marketing. Highly recommended if you face a
          challenge creating and selling your stuff.

        <p>
          I read through this book twice now. First read: I learned to search
          for stillness instead of calmness. Big difference!
        </p>
        <p>
          Second read: I found out I do everything without requesting for
          help. That's why I feel drained and tired.

        <p>
          Do you have people you find difficult to talk to? My wife
          <em>was</em> one such person. This book gave me the techniques to
          start a proper conversation with her.
